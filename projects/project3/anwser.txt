\f0\fs24 \cf0 Project 3 is noticeably faster than project 2 because project 3 is implemented with a linked list instead of an array. We do not know the amount of data that our program will encounter until run time which can lead to performance bottle-necks when using arrays. If the initial size of the array is exceeded then we need to copy all of the data into a larger array which takes time and resources. On the other hand if the initial array size is too large then we are using more memory then is necessary and we should reduce the size of the array which again takes time and resources to do. However linked lists do not required a chunk of reserved memory to work. It allocates memory when it needs it and deallocates memory when it is done using it.}
